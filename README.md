# Ergonaut â€“ Journal Editing Made Easy

Ergonaut is the ergonomic way to edit an academic journal. It is designed to be:

* Easy to use
* Attractive
* Free and open source

Ergonaut was created for the open access philosophy journal, [*Ergo*](http://www.ergophiljournal.org). Several of *Ergo*'s distinctive editorial policies are thus baked in:

* Two-tiered editorial structure:
    + Managing editors designate area editors, assign submitted manuscripts to them, and approve/finalize their decisions.
    + Area editors read submissions, solicit referee reports when appropriate, and submit their decisions to the managing editors for approval.
* Triple-anonymous review:
    + Area editors are not shown authors' identities.
    + Authors are not shown their referees' or area editor's identities.
    + Referees are not shown authors' identities.
* Four decisions about a submission are possible:
    + Accept
    + Minor revisions
    + Major revisions
    + Reject

Future versions will probably be more flexible, with at least some of these features becoming optional.
